# Laravel Server Side Google Analytics

This is a simple package that allows tou to track Google Analytics pageviews and
events from your Laravel application. It was created because we needed a simple
way to track these when certain actions occured server-side or when specific actions
were triggered fromm the frontend and we din't want to mingle our JavaScript
logic with the analytics part.
