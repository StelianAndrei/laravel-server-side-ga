# Laravel Server Side Google Analytics

This is a simple package that allows you to track Google Analytics page views and
events from your Laravel application.

It was created because I needed a simple way to track these when certain actions
occured server-side or when specific actions were triggered from the frontend
and I din't want to mingle the JavaScript logic with the tracking part.
